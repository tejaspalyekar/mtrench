1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tejaspalyekar/mtrench.git

   ```

## Dependencies

All project dependencies are listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file. Running `flutter pub get` will automatically download and configure these dependencies for you.

## Testing Responsiveness and Interactivity

To ensure the responsiveness and interactivity of the Flutter UI, test it on various screen sizes and orientations using an emulator or a physical device.

## Screenshots and Video
